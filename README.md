# SPOTIFY-AUTOMATION-USING-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM-DATASET
We will first have top 50 songs based on popularity based recommender system then we will create a spotify playlist of these songs.

1. Datasets: 

    a. Triplet file: https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/10000.txt Contains user_id, song_id, ListenCount (in order)
    
    b. Metadata : https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/song_data.csv
    
    
2. Token Generation: As a token gets expired after a few hours so need to generate a new token after itâ€™s expiry. 

    a. Click on get token button: (on this link: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/) 
    
    b. After selecting the required scopes click on Request token. Your new token will be available, copy it and use it.
